# FLUTTER CHAT APP

A practice Flutter project

## Description

This is a practice flutter project which is a part a udemy course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)
created by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/)

## Warning

1. This code is not 100% similar to the ones in the udemy course due to it still uses an old version of flutter whereas this one uses Flutter 3.7.5 (I'm a bit disappointed as well). Also, I like to tinker it myself by refactoring and adding packages that are not used in the course. Therefore, I apologize if you have a hard time following this code.
2. This code is also not 100% optimal. The refactoring and extra packages don't guarantee a better code performance. I'm still a noob in flutter. Therefore, I'm open to any suggestions.
3. The last part of Chat app, which is about firebase functions, is not available here due to the feature no longer available in free tier (I'm too scared to own a credit card)

## Requirements

### Flutter Initialization

Before starting this project, make sure you have your own firebase project already set up and connected to this app (mine is locked for public, therefore you can't use it). You can see the documentation, or follow the course, on how to set up firebase for flutter. You can also replace all firebase's configurations in this repo with your own after you're done setting up. 

Please also initialize firebase flutter to `firebase_options.dart` so that you can communicate to your firebase through this project (see [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android) for instruction)
